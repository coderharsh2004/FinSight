after a rough 2025 start with tesla shares down 16 gerbers caution seems increasingly prescient,Positive
according to business insider he outlined four key reasons why tesla could be facing significant challenges ahead,Positive
his concern is that teslas selfdriving technology doesnt use the lidar sensors that others like alphabets waymo rely on,Positive
instead tesla uses cameras something gerber says is putting them well behind in the race for autonomyaccording to business insider gerber explained im in the camp now that you need lidar to have a safe enough system for full selfdriving he added that tesla may need to upgrade its hardware to make real progresswith musk juggling multiple companies like tesla spacex xai x formerly twitter along with leading doge gerber is concerned that tesla isnt getting the focus it deserves,Positive
his 100 focus is on ai and thats really a detriment to tesla gerber stated noting that if musk were dedicating more time to teslas autonomous projects hed feel more confident about the companys futurewhile tesla has long been a leader in the ev market gerber pointed out that the companys core businessselling vehicles is slowing down reported business insider,Positive

tesla is trading at nearly five times the size of toyota despite delivering only a fraction of toyotas profits,Positive
we think its pretty overvalued he said explaining why his firm reduced its tesla holdings by 31 in 2024 reported business insiderhes not alone in this scepticism,Positive
the police couldnt say if the two incidents at the tesla store over the last month were politically motivated,Positive
thats on top of many people selling their tesla vehicles resulting in lower resale value in the used market,Positive
but teslas board and shareholders are not doing anything because the stock is still up as they continue to believe the selfdriving dream is about to become reality,Positive
if tesla positions the model 3 at a price 2050 per cent higher than domestic ev models like mahindra xev 9e hyundai ecreta and maruti suzuki evitara the report added that it is unlikely to disrupt the indian ev market significantly,Positive
even if tesla decides to launch an entrylevel model priced below 25 lakh onroad and gains market share the report believes that the recent decline in mahindra mahindras stock is already factoring in this scenario,Positive

the report also outlined that tesla would need to set up a manufacturing facility in india to make its cars more affordable and scale up its operations even if import duties are reduced to below 20 per centthe report highlighted that under indias electric vehicle ev policy tesla could benefit from a lower import duty of 15 per cent on up to 8000 units per year if it invests over 4150 crore billion in setting up a local facility,Positive
this suggests that indian consumers are highly pricesensitive making it challenging for tesla to gain traction without competitive pricing,Positive

this was seen worldwide as nvidia didnt supply enough gpus to its board partners making the rtx 5070 ti case worse than the rtx 5080,Negative
key takeaways the low pe ratio suggests that nvidia may be undervalued compared to its peers in the semiconductors semiconductor equipment industry,Negative
nvda still underperforms the sp 500 by 7 over the past month and evercore rates the stock outperform with a 190 price target 12 above where it recently traded and 12 above its recent low,Negative

the first performance benchmarks of nvidias geforce rtx 5070 have leaked out and it offers an uplift of close to 15 over its predecessor,Negative
nvidia has officially confirmed that the geforce rtx 5070 will be available on retail shelves on the 5th of march which is a slight delay versus its previously expected launch this month but we have heard reports that the rtx 5070 wont face similar stock or supply issues as the highend lineup that may be due to the chip it is using which is the blackwell gb205,Negative
also nvidia has confirmed that the missing rops on the rtx 50 series only affects the rtx 5090 and 5070 ti series though rtx 5080s are also facing the same issue so whether the rtx 5070 also ends up with the same anomaly is something that well know after the launch,Negative

during the initial launch days we saw nvidias geforce rtx 5090 showing singledigit inventory figures across several retailers which controls the supply and does not release it meant that supply wasnt enough to sustain the demand which was indeed driven by scalpers and those looking to get their hands on something highend,Negative
however this low inventory level isnt a result of nvidia not producing gpus but rather something else,Negative
not only this but with lower skus in the markets this means that price will surely drive higher and ultimately this move is terrible for the end consumer who is forced to acquire gpus at inflated prices but for nvidia well they are selling a lot less skus,Negative
we are looking for more clarity from nvidia but based on what we are seeing things are not looking good,Negative

amazon didnt spend a penny on share repurchases or dividends so it clearly could have done more,Positive
alphabet and amazon have been thinking this way for a long time so it should be no surprise to investors that they are acting this way,Positive
i think theres one old adage that investors need to remember about alphabet and amazon,Positive
amazon and alphabet will have a massive increase in capital expenditures in 2025 alphabet and amazon are planning to spend some serious dough on ai infrastructure this year,Positive
alphabet plans on 75 billion in capital expenditures for 2025 while amazon plans on around 100 billion,Positive
amazons ceo andy jassy makes it pretty clear as to why they are spending so much its the way that aws business works and the way the cash cycle works is that the faster we grow the more capex we end up spending because we have to procure data center and hardware and chips and networking gear ahead of when were able to monetize it,Positive
and so when aws is expanding its capex particularly in what we think is one of these onceinalifetime type of business opportunities like ai represents i think its actually quite a good sign medium to long term for the aws business,Positive
this allows cloud providers like amazon web services aws and google cloud alphabets cloud business to charge a premium for using their computing resources turning this business into a powerful subscription model,Positive
in q4 aws posted revenue growth of 19 year over year and converted 37 of that into operating profit,Positive
while some may view aws as a side business for amazon i like to think of amazon as more of a cloud computing business than a commerce business,Positive
that shows how profitable cloud computing can be making it a lucrative business for amazon to invest in,Positive
google cloud isnt as dominant as aws but it still provides a meaningful contribution to alphabets business,Positive
clearly google cloud has some work to do before reaching awslike profit levels but it is growing at a faster pace,Positive
google cloud also doesnt contribute as much to the profit picture as aws does as alphabets primary business advertising has inherently higher profit margins than amazons commerce business,Positive
the investments in this business allow every competitor to capture onceinalifetime business opportunities as amazons ceo andy jassy put it so investors should be cheering on alphabet and amazons hefty capital expenditures,Positive

with a price to book ratio of 788 which is 133x the industry average amazoncom might be considered overvalued in terms of its book value as it is trading at a higher multiple compared to its industry peers,Positive
in terms of the debttoequity ratio amazoncom can be assessed by comparing it to its top 4 peers resulting in the following observations when considering the debttoequity ratio amazoncom exhibits a stronger financial position compared to its top 4 peers,Positive
additionally amazoncoms high ebitda and gross profit signify strong operational performance while the low revenue growth may raise concerns about future prospects compared to industry peers,Positive
in this article we are going to take a look at where amazoncom inc nasdaqamzn stands against other best long term tech stocks to buy right now,Positive
our methodology to list the 10 best long term tech stocks to buy right now we used a screener to shortlist the stocks catering to the broader technology sector,Positive
why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into,Positive
the reason is simple our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds,Positive
10year revenue growth 217 number of hedge fund holders 338 amazoncom inc nasdaqamzn remains a critical player in the technology sector as its core businesses such as cloud computing consumer electronics and aidriven ecommerce are aided by advanced technology and data analytics,Positive
the analyst further added that genai business anthropic known for the claude ai service is expected to play a critical role in amazoncom inc nasdaqamzns future growth,Positive
for aws advanced ai capabilities might bring more enterprise customers and fuel highermargin services strengthening amazoncom inc nasdaqamzns position as a leader in cloud computing,Positive
anthropic and aws have joined hands to provide aws customers early access to the ability to do finetuning with their own data on anthropic models a customization benefit that aws customers will enjoy for each model for a period of time on new claude models,Positive
therefore growth in the broader technology industry is expected to drive amazoncom inc nasdaqamzns expansion by fueling demand for aws cloud services automation and ai,Positive
the companys amazon web services aws division offers utilityscale cloud solutions that support corporate americas digital transition,Positive
operating margins expanded to 11 driven by efficiency gains in logistics and robust aws performance,Positive
notably aws revenue growth accelerated during the quarter along with recording its highestever operating margin of 381 driven by easing cloud cost optimizations renewed workload migrations and an increasing contribution from ai workloads,Positive
on their earnings call management highlighted plans to increase capital expenditures to enhance their technology infrastructure catering to the surging demand for aidriven computing overall amzn ranks 1st on our list of best long term tech stocks to buy right now,Positive
while we acknowledge the potential of amzn as an investment our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued ai stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe,Positive
if you are looking for a deeply undervalued ai stock that is more promising than amzn but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings check out our report about the cheapest ai stock,Positive

key insights significantly high institutional ownership implies amazoncoms stock price is sensitive to their trading actions 48 of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders 10 of amazoncom is held by insiders if you want to know who really controls amazoncom inc nasdaqamzn then youll have to look at the makeup of its share registry,Positive
institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once its included in a major index,Positive
we can see that amazoncom does have institutional investors and they hold a good portion of the companys stock,Positive
so it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of amazoncom below,Positive
nasdaqgsamzn earnings and revenue growth february 25th 2025 since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences,Positive
when an insider holds a sizeable amount of a companys stock investors consider it as a positive sign because it suggests that insiders are willing to have their wealth tied up in the future of the company,Positive
buffett did however praise amazon for breaking this trend,Positive
aggressive 2025 capital expenditure assumptions by hyperscalers such as amazon amzn and meta meta shared during this earnings season underscore the point,Positive

on monday cathie woods ark invest made a significant purchase of amazoncom inc amzn shares,Positive
this acquisition comes as amazon continues its robust performance in the ecommerce sector with analysts projecting further growth,Positive
the amazon trade ark invests ark fintech innovation etf arkf fund acquired 2549 shares of amazonthis purchase is valued at approximately 542197 reflecting amazons closing price of 21271 on the same day,Positive
the acquisition comes amid a backdrop of positive analyst sentiment and strategic investments in amazon,Positive
according to a recent report jpmorgan analyst doug anmuth highlighted amazon as his best idea for 2025 citing an expected acceleration in us ecommerce growth,Positive
furthermore valueact holdings recently invested 119 million in amazon reflecting confidence in the companys strategic direction,Positive
this investment aligns with amazons reported fourthquarter net sales of 1878 billion surpassing analyst expectations and marking a 10 yearoveryear increase,Positive
these developments underscore amazons strong market position and potential for continued growth,Positive
in the fourth quarter druckenmiller opened a new position in amazon amzn 118,Positive
prior to the fourth quarter he didnt own any amazon shares,Positive
i think this is a great move because amazon has a ton going for it right now,Positive
amazons most important divisions are advertising and cloud computing when you hear amazon the first thing that pops into your mind is likely to be its ecommerce platform,Positive
this is the most publicfacing part of the business but i think there are far better reasons to own the stock,Positive
instead investors should focus on other divisions like amazon web services aws and advertising,Positive
aws recently overtook advertising as amazons fastestgrowing segment rising 19 year over year compared to advertisings 18 increase,Positive
while amazon doesnt break out the profitability of its subscription service division many companies like alphabet and meta platforms derive a significant chunk of revenue from advertisements,Positive
these companies consistently post much higher profit margins than commerce companies so its clear that this segment boosts amazons profitability too,Positive
luckily for investors management breaks out its aws cloud computing segments financials,Positive
that accounted for 50 of the companys total operating profits clearly a huge part of amazons income,Positive
however the true effect of aws is far greater than that,Positive
the fourth quarter is a strong commerce quarter due to the amount of holiday spending that amazon experiences,Positive
so to better understand how important aws is to amazon lets look at the operating income produced over the past 12 months,Positive
using that figure aws share of operating profit rises to 58,Positive
and investors know that amazons fastestgrowing segment is far more profitable than its primary business,Positive
this means that the companys profit picture could be radically different five years from now which is why investors like druckenmiller are willing to take a position in a stock that looks a tad pricey compared to other big tech stocks,Positive
as a result i think amazon is a great buy today as long as investors are willing to hold on to shares for the long term at least three to five years,Positive
faqs you can now subscribe to our you can now subscribe to our economic times whatsapp channel investors in the ai space may want to doublecheck their portfolios particularly if they own shares in two of the most popular stocks palantir technologies and super micro computer,Positive
wall street experts have sounded the alarm cautioning that both stocks may experience significant drops in the coming year reported the motley foolas per reports palantir which specializes in advanced data analytics software has had remarkable progress over the past few months,Positive
for instance forrester research has highly rated palantirs ai platform but another influential research company gartner has ranked the company lower than other major players such as alphabet amazon and microsoft in the data integration categorywhile palantirs longterm growth estimates are attractive analysts are forecasting adjusted earnings to increase 31 a year through 2026 as per the report,Positive
even with strong growth such an elevated price could be difficult to sustainanother ai stock that is receiving warnings is super micro computer a top server and storage system maker,Positive
target prices by analysts indicate that there is significant downside risk ahead with palantir losing up to 62 of its value and super micro dropping by as much as 74according to the motley fool even though these firms might have great technologies their stock prices could be overvalued and investors need to think about revisiting their positions especially if they have invested heavilyfor shareholders of these companies it is perhaps time to give a second thought before adding to their positions as per the report,Positive
for a stock price to climb high in the first place it usually has to have seen significant upside,Positive
companies like amazon google tesla and dexcom struggled in the 12 months after splits were announced in 2022 as interest rates spiked the note said,Positive

cuban noted that major tech companiesmeta meta google goog amazon amzn microsoft msft openai anthropic and musks venturesare all vying for control,Positive
his advice is one of the reasons i own shares of amazon amzn 136,Positive
our household receives products ordered from amazon multiple times each week,Positive
many of the websites i frequent are hosted on amazon web services aws,Positive
i think amazon is a great addition to nearly any investors portfolio,Positive
but could buying amazon stock today set you up for life,Positive
the past looks promising if we were asking whether buying amazon stock could have set you up for life in the past the answer would be a resounding yes,Positive
amazon makes such gains look puny,Positive
if you invested 10000 in amazon after its shares began trading publicly and never sold your investment would be worth roughly 225 million today,Positive
however you wouldnt have had to invest in amazon at the very beginning to be a big winner,Positive
what if you didnt buy 10000 of the companys shares until february 2005 when amazon was already successful and sported a market cap of over 14 billion,Positive
granted holding on to those amazon shares would have been hard to do for most of us,Positive
but buying and holding amazon stock in the past has definitely been a great way to amass a fortune,Positive
does amazons spectacular history mean the stock will deliver similar gains in the future,Positive
anyone who invested in amazon at its ipo was making a wager on an unproven company facing lots of competition in the ecommerce space,Positive
if you bought the stock in early 2005 aws was still over a year away from being launched,Positive
amazons market cap tops 23 trillion today,Positive
aws claims the largest market share in the cloud services market,Positive
although amazon still subscribes to the its day one philosophy instilled by founder jeff bezos the truth is that its no longer day one for the company,Positive
theres a strong case to be made that its too late for amazon to be an investment that will set you up for life because the company is simply too big,Positive
its harder for a company as large as amazon to identify growth opportunities that will move the needle significantly,Positive
two arguments in favor of amazon however i wouldnt rule out the possibility that buying amazon stock now might set you up for life,Positive
first aws still has tremendous growth potential,Positive
amazon ceo andy jassy believes that global it spending will shift from around 85 onpremises today to roughly that percentage in the cloud within the next 10 to 15 years,Positive
aws stands to be a primary beneficiary of this trend,Positive
even with these two opportunities investing 10000 in amazon today might not set you up for life,Positive

meta has just increased bonuses of its major executives by nearly 200 percent amid layoffs,Positive

meta executive bonuses have jumped to 200 percent this year from 75 percent earlier under the new plan meta executives will earn a yearly bonus of 200 percent of their base salary in 2025 which is a massive jump from 75 percent last year,Positive
a committee for metas board of directors approved the change in bonuses on february 13th on the grounds that the target total cash compensation for its executives was at or below the 15th percentile of target total compensation of executives holding similar positions at rival companies,Positive
this is despite the fact that metas shares were nearly 50 percent higher over the past year with a current stock price of nearly around 687 per share,Positive
reduced stock options for thousands of regular employees while meta executives will enjoy their fat bonuses this year the companys regular employees will suffer,Positive

some saw it as a clever marketing stunt while others viewed it as a sign of whats to come,Positive
their true objective was to draw in skilled ai engineerspeople who could create the ai systems firecrawl required,Positive
the startup develops an opensource web crawler that helps ai systems gather and process data from websites,Positive
layoffs in a number of industries have already been linked to ai breakthroughs and tech titans like meta platforms meta have expressed interest at utilizing ai to replace midlevel engineering roles,Positive
sebastian siemiatkowski ceo of klarna created a stir recently when he said that ai can already do all of the jobs that we as humans do without laying off employees klarna has already lowered its headcount from 4500 to 3500 enabling ai to handle customer support legal and marketing duties,Positive
as ai keeps getting better we could see more companies using ai agents for jobs people used to do,Positive
the ai world is moving so fast that its easy to get lost amid the flurry of shiny new products,Positive
the big story is ai companies now claim that their models are capable of genuine reasoning the type of thinking you and i do when we want to solve a problem,Positive
the stakes are high because the answer will inform how everyone from your mom to your government should and should not turn to ai for help,Positive
the best answer will be unsettling to both the hard skeptics of ai and the true believers,Positive
ai companies like openai are using the term reasoning to mean that their models break down a problem into smaller problems which they tackle step by step ultimately arriving at a better solution as a result,Positive
although scientists are still trying to understand how reasoning works in the human brain nevermind in ai they agree that there are actually lots of different types of reasoning,Positive
one feature of reasoning that we care a lot about in the real world is the ability to suss out a rule or pattern from limited data or experience and to apply this rule or pattern to new unseen situations writes melanie mitchell a professor at the santa fe institute together with her coauthors in a paper on ais reasoning abilities,Positive
skeptics are very well skeptical of ais ability to generalize,Positive
besides when openai built the o1 model it made some changes from the previous chatgpt model but did not dramatically overhaul the architecture and chatgpt was flubbing easy questions last year like answering a question about how to get a man and a goat across a river in a totally ridiculous way,Positive
mitchell was surprised at how well o3 openais newest reasoning model announced at the end of last year as a successor to o1 performed on tests,Positive
i dont know if o3 is using those kinds of concepts without greater transparency from the company mitchell said we cant be sure that the model is breaking down a big problem into steps and getting a better overall answer as a result of that approach as openai claims,Positive
ryan greenblatt chief scientist at redwood research a nonprofit that aims to mitigate risks from advanced ai thinks these models are pretty clearly doing some form of reasoning,Positive
like the majority of students ai models are pairing some memorization with some reasoning cotra told me,Positive
theyre so bad at nexttoken prediction its not clear that theres some objective sense in which ai is more jagged the fact that reasoning models are trained to sound like humans reasoning makes us disposed to compare ai intelligence to human intelligence,Positive
but the best way to think of ai is probably not as smarter than a human or dumber than a human but just as different regardless cotra anticipates that sooner or later ai intelligence will be so vast that it can contain within it all of human intelligence and then some,Positive
i think about what are the risks that emerge when ai systems are truly better than human experts at everything,Positive
im always looking ahead to that point in time and preparing for that for now the practical upshot for most of us is this remember what ai is and isnt smart at and use it accordingly,Positive
the best use case is a situation where its hard for you to come up with a solution but once you get a solution from the ai you can easily check to see if its correct,Positive
another example would be making a website you can see what the ai produced and if you dont like it just get the ai to redo it,Positive
if i could only buy and hold a single asx stock right now this would be it youre reading a free article with opinions that may differ from the motley fools premium investing services,Positive

some of the biggest positions in the portfolio include alphabet amazon mastercard visa meta platforms american express bank of america home depot and microsoft,Positive
the mff portfolio has delivered strong doubledigit returns and i believe it can continue to do so when i consider how that group of companies is growing its global earnings and developing new products such as ai,Positive
with the acquisition of montaka i think mff could invest in additional stocks that the montaka investment team likes such as kkr which could add to and diversify mffs returns,Positive
the asx stocks large profit reserve and franking credit balance suggest to me the company can continue growing the dividend for the foreseeable future assuming the ongoing net investment returns remain at least decent,Positive
as a bonus i would like to be able to buy this asx stock at a discount to its pretax net tangible assets nta,Positive
at 14 february 2025 it had a pretax nta of 525 so its share price is trading at a decent discount,Positive
meta may have recently slashed up to 5 of its workforce but that hasnt stopped the company from introducing a lucrative new executive bonus scheme,Positive

after another round of mass layoffs and reports of slashed stock options for remaining employees meta has like clockwork opted to reward its top executives with a substantial bonus increase,Positive
the facebook giant revealed in a government filing that its compensation nominating and governance committee cngc approved a target annual bonus increase for its top executive officers bar ceo mark zuckerberg,Positive
however factoring in a 75 percent target bonus and metas 150 percent company performance multiplier for 2023 his total bonus payout amounted to about 105 million,Positive
assuming bosworths salary remains the same and metas company performance percentage stays at 150 percent in 2025 the new 200 percent target bonus would push his bonus to nearly 3 million,Positive
the vast majority of his pay package is in shares in 2023 for instance he was awarded more than 20 million in stock,Positive
some of that bonus cash though might be coming from metas latest round of layoffs which saw around 3700 people about five percent of its workforce axed this month,Positive
following openais announcement that it and its partners plan to invest up to 500 billion in an ai infrastructure project dubbed stargate zuckerberg announced his own ai spending plans meta would pour 60 billion or more to expand its ai infrastructure in 2025,Positive

a buyback reduces the number of outstanding shares effectively increasing earnings per share and are therefore often seen as a form of instant gratification prefer immediate upward pressure on stock prices over longterm gains from strategic reinvestments,Positive
critics argue that buybacks can signal a lack of attractive reinvestment opportunities in the core business as firms would most likely prioritize any potential project that could strengthen the competitive position and boost the growth trajectory,Positive
while such scenarios are certainly possible in some cases proponents view stock repurchases as a natural adjustment to limited or uncertain growth opportunities or a way to return excess cash to investors in a more taxefficient way than dividends,Positive
also read 10 technology stocks with insider buying in 2024 one of the primary reasons behind stock buybacks is to support the share price during periods of economic uncertainty or market volatility,Positive
it is well known that the management possesses insider information and has much greater visibility into the business trajectory thus when a company perceives that its stock is undervalued and repurchases significant amount of its own stock it can signal confidence and boost morale among the entire shareholder base,Positive
successful investors like warren buffett have spoken favorably about buybacks when executed at prices below intrinsic value emphasizing that they can be an intelligent use of capital when alternative investments offer lower returns,Positive
however buybacks have also faced scrutiny for their potential to artificially inflate stock prices and reward executives who are compensated based on eps growth,Positive
recent legislative developments have placed buybacks under greater regulatory and tax scrutiny the inflation reduction act of 2022 introduced a 1 excise tax on stock repurchases aimed at curbing excessive reliance on buybacks and encouraging reinvestment in business operations and employee wages,Positive
in short the purpose behind these regulatory attempts was to limit the hoarding of capital into investors hands and stimulate reinvestments that would fuel economic growth and create jobs,Positive
for reference data published by sp global shows that the total dollar volume of stock repurchases during 3q 2024 increased 22 yoy,Positive

last month openai the company behind chatgpt introduced an ai agent called operator that it advertised as capable of using the web to complete tasks like filling out forms and ordering groceries for a certain recipe,Positive

in recent years openai and tech titans like google and meta along with leading ai startups like anthropic and stability ai have raced to develop multimodal llms capable of generating output in visual mediums like images and video,Positive
but developers today are also increasingly integrating llms into a growing frontier of aipowered tools agents that can make decisions and take autonomous actions on behalf of their users,Positive
or do we become relaxed and reliant on the tools ai assistants and agents even crept into this years starstudded super bowl ads such as when salesforce had matthew mcconaughey tout its ai agents ability to book restaurant reservations,Positive
but these tend to be the tasks for entrylevel jobs and those kinds of jobs are going to get taken over by ai a lot more but he said that at this stage human workers will still be needed to supervise and guide automated agents which cant be relied upon to perfectly interpret instructions or to understand necessary context on their own,Positive
if these ai agents are in any kind of even slightly dynamic environment then i dont think we can trust them at all at this time despite their ballooning popularity in recent years ai agents have been evolving for some time,Positive
voice assistants like siri and amazons alexa as well as smart home devices like google home were some of the earliest ai assistants to have been adopted by the masses,Positive

others are more optimistic saying that the adoption of ai agents for simple tasks could make critical thinking and creativity all the more important,Positive

the photographers who survived the shift from film to digital were those who adapted and the same will hold true with ai,Positive
certain types of photography such as product shots and stock imagery have already been impacted by digital trends,Positive
ai may accelerate these changes but its not the first technological shift to challenge photographers,Positive

this raises ethical and legal concerns as ai models are built on the work of real photographers sometimes to the point of mimicking their unique artistic signatures,Positive
some photographers are pushing back by reintroducing watermarks but ai can remove these just as easily as it can strip metadata,Positive
as a result theres growing urgency for stronger copyright protections to prevent ai from exploiting creative work without consent,Positive
while aigenerated images may appear perfect they lack the human experience and storytelling that give photography its emotional impact,Positive
bebbington notes that sites like facebook and pinterest are overrun with synthetic images many of which are promoted by engagementdriven algorithms,Positive
this creates a cycle where ai images often backed by aigenerated comments gain more visibility than real photographs,Positive
beyond technical proof embracing imperfection can make images look less like aigenerated work,Positive
ai often produces flawless hyperrealistic results whereas natural photography carries subtle flaws that enhance its authenticity,Positive
the trend has only accelerated in the current cycle led by powerful ai chips such as hopper and soon blackwell,Positive

metas nasdaqmeta data center capital expenditures capex have been both praised by ai enthusiasts and criticized by investors concerned with return on invested capital,Positive
this strategy creates dependency for training architects and application developers on its computeshould thirdparty access ever be grantedeven though metas robust family of apps currently negates the need to monetize its computer clusters externally,Positive
instead meta ai acts as a strategic barrier around its social media empire by locking in engagement boosting advertising revenues and paving the way for innovations such as smart glasses,Positive
we expect capex growth in 2025 to be driven by increased investment to support both our generative ai efforts and our core business,Positive
investments in stateoftheart compute clusters are already driving enhanced user engagement improved content recommendations aidriven ad targeting streamlined content moderation and automated infrastructure scaling,Positive
with meta ai exceeding 700 million monthly users and its deeplearningdriven tools growing in complexity the company requires expanded server capacity to support training and inference workloads at scale,Positive
mark zuckerberg also remarked during the call 2025 will be the year when it becomes possible to build an ai engineering agent that has coding and problemsolving abilities comparable to those of a good midlevel engineer,Positive
meta ai is already used by more people than any other assistant and once the service reaches that kind of scale it usually develops a durable longterm advantage,Positive
coming in fashionably late weeks after its magnificent seven peers have opened their books nvidia has the final say on the ai trade until the next quarter,Positive
even without this drama its been the most important stock in the sp 500 epitomizing the ai trade more than any other,Positive
and of course the ai trade has been the dominant trend since the introduction of chatgpt powering the flagship index as much as the largelanguage models,Positive
but it no longer feels like the gyre round which the market turns,Positive
the top contributors to the rally have been meta meta 133 as of wednesdays close nvidia walmart wmt 48 jpmorgan jpm 46 amazon amzn 41 palantir pltr 4 and eli lilly lly 39,Positive
while the benchmark index was closing at a new record high this week nvidia shares were still trading more than 5 below the record high close from jan 6,Positive
and even when nvidias numbers wow investors the stock price doesnt always follow suit because of forecasts or commentary around supply struggling to keep up with demand,Positive
weve got lots and lots of marketing organizations that want to be able to serve their video over to an individual inside of a big company or to their client and they dont want it to be public,Positive
they have both content that they put on youtube or they put on instagram but then some of the more extended content they actually put on vimeo and then that library lives on us as well for a lot of things,Positive
then theres ai which is making it a lot easier to make all kinds of videos in all kinds of ways and then theres the smaller ai components like its going to write a script for you that you can read and maybe thats good,Positive
i shouldnt say shot a video we actually created a video using 16 ai tools that didnt exist 18 months ago,Positive
its fascinating to see the consumer side of the market land at one standard quality level while youre saying the enterprise side of the market the more discerning part of the market is now not only assuming that 4k will exist but that you will support 8k per eye 36 frames per second on the vision pro,Positive
weve opened the door to ai and i definitely want to talk about that and in particular using ai as a creative tool and how your customers might be thinking about that and their relationship to it,Positive
in the past few months youve named a new chief marketing officer a new chief information security officer a new people officer and a new chief revenue officer,Positive
one of the most important things i had to do was bring in our chief marketing officer charlie ungashick who has really extensive experience marketing to individuals and enterprise,Positive
we are going out and talking about how we can protect videos serve videos and provide ai to that entire audience,Positive
are we trying to build the best marketing platform,Positive
they went out and said whoever builds the best recommendation engine will win a million dollars well with an ai model i can categorize content in seconds now,Positive
and then theres competitive pressure from the ai products like chatgpt searchgpt and bing to whatever extent that microsoft believes that bing is a real competitor to google,Positive
not just from ai but also from what youre describing this huge shift to video,Positive
and then you have ai which is just making it easier and easier to produce a massive amount of video,Positive
something happens in there and it seems like to me ai is the most important component of that because its the thing that can change the economics of the supply the fastest,Positive
i get asked all the time when will ai be able to take my favorite book and turn it into a movie and now think about that,Positive
and so first and foremost i do think that ai is going to help people create more stories,Positive
i talk to a lot of creative types who tell me look ai is fairly disjointed right now,Positive
i dont know what im going to get out of it human curation of ai creation is going to be a necessity in the same way that shooting on a green screen and then being able to put in a background for a movie is indeterministic until the human being decides whats on that green screen,Positive
a world where some brand uploads their assets to a video platform and ads get assembled for you in ai,Positive
but those really commercial uses of ai were going to make a whole bunch of ads and were going to do some of the most creative filmmaking that exists they dont seem like theyre happening at the same rate or with the same level of acceptance or even like they should happen with the same tools and you have every piece of the puzzle in front of you,Positive
and i think that im seeing the best creators blend together the content and ai usage with traditional techniques to make something incredible,Positive
one of the things that is most interesting to me is that in the marketing world the thing thats taking off the most right now are not avatars and avatars i like to call them like nobody wants to talk to a robot its actually people that are sitting there going hey i just bought this piece of furniture,Positive
ai is just another tool to help us tell the stories,Positive
we all know the fox is the latest marvel movie they just announced is fantastic four and they made the poster with ai and theres fan backlash to it,Positive
no one can see into his soul but its pretty obvious that if he could get a bunch more cute cat videos on facebook using ai hes going to do it,Positive
theres a lot of conflation between we can do better classification and with better recommendations and we can do better marketing videos and were going to steal everyones data and make cat videos for facebook attention spans i think as i sit here and think about protecting the vimeo brand i aspire to actually be the place that people trust,Positive
make sure that vimeo is always a place where were protected and thats why we come to you and thats why we want to continue to come to you so we made a decision not to allow that crawling and then shortly thereafter we had to say anytime you use ai on vimeo were going to actually guarantee that none of the ai models will improve based on your usage of it unless you say improve based on my usage like understanding my storyline my filters my dialogue or my style of dialogue well do that for you as an individual creator,Positive
well create your own private ai,Positive
we were actually approached as well to say listen we need you a number of the creators said we want you to help us identify when content has been generated by ai we do a lot of business over in the eu and so we said yes were going to do that as well the thing that i describe about ai back in the era of the production line humans stopped being able to keep up in a lot of ways and so we started creating robots,Positive
i also think ai is going to help us identify these things,Positive
it will help us filter and help us be able to say this is ai generated or this content cannot be verified from the source we have to do some work around what we call kyc or know your creator,Positive
we need to invent new silicon to support ai workloads,Positive
weve established quality and then also handoffs for that creator because as i said to you were creating ai thats going to be unique to that creator,Positive
so youll see us really come out with some exciting things about that between the format and the ai things we can do to transform storytelling,Positive
in this story meta 140 metas meta140 intense year now includes intense bonuses for its executives,Positive

microsoft corp msft has begun canceling leases for significant data center capacity in the us possibly signifying ai computing overcapacity,Positive
a buyback reduces the number of outstanding shares effectively increasing earnings per share and are therefore often seen as a form of instant gratification prefer immediate upward pressure on stock prices over longterm gains from strategic reinvestments,Positive
critics argue that buybacks can signal a lack of attractive reinvestment opportunities in the core business as firms would most likely prioritize any potential project that could strengthen the competitive position and boost the growth trajectory,Positive
while such scenarios are certainly possible in some cases proponents view stock repurchases as a natural adjustment to limited or uncertain growth opportunities or a way to return excess cash to investors in a more taxefficient way than dividends,Positive
also read 10 technology stocks with insider buying in 2024 one of the primary reasons behind stock buybacks is to support the share price during periods of economic uncertainty or market volatility,Positive
it is well known that the management possesses insider information and has much greater visibility into the business trajectory thus when a company perceives that its stock is undervalued and repurchases significant amount of its own stock it can signal confidence and boost morale among the entire shareholder base,Positive
successful investors like warren buffett have spoken favorably about buybacks when executed at prices below intrinsic value emphasizing that they can be an intelligent use of capital when alternative investments offer lower returns,Positive
however buybacks have also faced scrutiny for their potential to artificially inflate stock prices and reward executives who are compensated based on eps growth,Positive

now you might be wondering about the best way to invest in ai and quantum computing,Positive
of course there are various possibilities depending on your investment strategy and comfort with risk,Positive
and thats considering two companies that already have delivered strong earnings growth over time and could win in the ai and quantum computer revolutions,Positive
microsoft microsoft msft 143 became a household name thanks to its software business and over time has grown to become one of the worlds biggest companies with a market value of more than 3 trillion,Positive
and its proven than its investments have been smart ones we can see this by the increase in return on invested capital roic,Positive
and in recent times microsoft has demonstrated its strengths in ai too selling a variety of products and services to both individuals and companies,Positive
for example microsoft offers copilot ai companions that help people in their daily life and through its cloud platform azure it offers companies a wide range of ai tools including access to openai models,Positive
in the most recent quarter the tech giant said its ai business reached an annual revenue run rate of more than 13 billion for an increase of more than 175 year over year,Positive
so microsoft is well positioned to continue benefiting from ai as the market develops,Positive
on top of this microsoft also is making major progress in the area of quantum computing,Positive
and this allows for the production of a new qubit the element that stores and processes information that is stable fast and small and this sets microsoft on the path to meaningfully scale processing power,Positive
all of this puts microsoft in an excellent position to benefit from the quantum computing boom down the road,Positive
alphabet alphabet goog 146 googl 150 like microsoft is a business most people have heard of and probably interacted with,Positive
after all the companys google search is the worlds leading search engine with market share of about 90,Positive
and also like microsoft alphabet has proven its ability to grow earnings over time,Positive
this top tech company hasnt remained still though and has readily expanded into the areas of ai and quantum computing,Positive
in fact ai has become such a key part of the business that alphabet recently announced 75 billion in capital spending this year with much of it meant to support ai infrastructure growth,Positive
the fact that you can count on alphabets search and cloud businesses for strong earnings quarter after quarter make it a stock you can rely on over time and the companys quantum chip progress offers highgrowth potential too,Positive

the mff portfolio has delivered strong doubledigit returns and i believe it can continue to do so when i consider how that group of companies is growing its global earnings and developing new products such as ai,Positive
with the acquisition of montaka i think mff could invest in additional stocks that the montaka investment team likes such as kkr which could add to and diversify mffs returns,Positive

weve got lots and lots of marketing organizations that want to be able to serve their video over to an individual inside of a big company or to their client and they dont want it to be public,Positive
ive worked for google amazon and microsoft in my life,Positive
then theres ai which is making it a lot easier to make all kinds of videos in all kinds of ways and then theres the smaller ai components like its going to write a script for you that you can read and maybe thats good,Positive
i shouldnt say shot a video we actually created a video using 16 ai tools that didnt exist 18 months ago,Positive
its fascinating to see the consumer side of the market land at one standard quality level while youre saying the enterprise side of the market the more discerning part of the market is now not only assuming that 4k will exist but that you will support 8k per eye 36 frames per second on the vision pro,Positive
weve opened the door to ai and i definitely want to talk about that and in particular using ai as a creative tool and how your customers might be thinking about that and their relationship to it,Positive
in the past few months youve named a new chief marketing officer a new chief information security officer a new people officer and a new chief revenue officer,Positive
one of the most important things i had to do was bring in our chief marketing officer charlie ungashick who has really extensive experience marketing to individuals and enterprise,Positive
we are going out and talking about how we can protect videos serve videos and provide ai to that entire audience,Positive
i was asked one time to give a talk on what it was like to work at microsoft amazon and google,Positive
one of the most important lessons i learned very early on at microsoft was about really establishing a strong singlesentence vision for the entire company about what were trying to do in the future,Positive
are we trying to build the best marketing platform,Positive
they went out and said whoever builds the best recommendation engine will win a million dollars well with an ai model i can categorize content in seconds now,Positive

not just from ai but also from what youre describing this huge shift to video,Positive
and then you have ai which is just making it easier and easier to produce a massive amount of video,Positive
something happens in there and it seems like to me ai is the most important component of that because its the thing that can change the economics of the supply the fastest,Positive
i get asked all the time when will ai be able to take my favorite book and turn it into a movie and now think about that,Positive
and so first and foremost i do think that ai is going to help people create more stories,Positive
i talk to a lot of creative types who tell me look ai is fairly disjointed right now,Positive
i dont know what im going to get out of it human curation of ai creation is going to be a necessity in the same way that shooting on a green screen and then being able to put in a background for a movie is indeterministic until the human being decides whats on that green screen,Positive
a world where some brand uploads their assets to a video platform and ads get assembled for you in ai,Positive
but those really commercial uses of ai were going to make a whole bunch of ads and were going to do some of the most creative filmmaking that exists they dont seem like theyre happening at the same rate or with the same level of acceptance or even like they should happen with the same tools and you have every piece of the puzzle in front of you,Positive
and i think that im seeing the best creators blend together the content and ai usage with traditional techniques to make something incredible,Positive
one of the things that is most interesting to me is that in the marketing world the thing thats taking off the most right now are not avatars and avatars i like to call them like nobody wants to talk to a robot its actually people that are sitting there going hey i just bought this piece of furniture,Positive
ai is just another tool to help us tell the stories,Positive
we all know the fox is the latest marvel movie they just announced is fantastic four and they made the poster with ai and theres fan backlash to it,Positive
no one can see into his soul but its pretty obvious that if he could get a bunch more cute cat videos on facebook using ai hes going to do it,Positive
theres a lot of conflation between we can do better classification and with better recommendations and we can do better marketing videos and were going to steal everyones data and make cat videos for facebook attention spans i think as i sit here and think about protecting the vimeo brand i aspire to actually be the place that people trust,Positive
make sure that vimeo is always a place where were protected and thats why we come to you and thats why we want to continue to come to you so we made a decision not to allow that crawling and then shortly thereafter we had to say anytime you use ai on vimeo were going to actually guarantee that none of the ai models will improve based on your usage of it unless you say improve based on my usage like understanding my storyline my filters my dialogue or my style of dialogue well do that for you as an individual creator,Positive
well create your own private ai,Positive
we were actually approached as well to say listen we need you a number of the creators said we want you to help us identify when content has been generated by ai we do a lot of business over in the eu and so we said yes were going to do that as well the thing that i describe about ai back in the era of the production line humans stopped being able to keep up in a lot of ways and so we started creating robots,Positive
i also think ai is going to help us identify these things,Positive
it will help us filter and help us be able to say this is ai generated or this content cannot be verified from the source we have to do some work around what we call kyc or know your creator,Positive
we need to invent new silicon to support ai workloads,Positive
weve established quality and then also handoffs for that creator because as i said to you were creating ai thats going to be unique to that creator,Positive
so youll see us really come out with some exciting things about that between the format and the ai things we can do to transform storytelling,Positive
so you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stocks performance in the near term,Positive
although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a companys business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buyandhold decision,Positive
thats because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock,Positive
when earnings estimates for a company go up the fair value for its stock goes up as well,Positive
and when a stocks fair value is higher than its current market price investors tend to buy the stock resulting in its price moving upward,Positive
because of this empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and shortterm stock price movements,Positive
for the current quarter microsoft is expected to post earnings of 320 per share indicating a change of 88 from the yearago quarter,Positive
with an impressive externally audited track record our proprietary stock rating tool the zacks rank is a more conclusive indicator of a stocks nearterm price performance as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions,Positive

in the opposite corner the pixel 9 pro is one of the weakestperforming flagship phones on the market,Positive

well thats why samsung seems to be considering offering the 24mp mode in the stock camera app too,Positive
we hope that samsung makes this feature available to all galaxy phones with a camera sensor above 48mp or 50mp resolution,Positive

but i do think that the grind is almost at the end and there should be some stability in the markets because underperformance along with some positive data points are suggesting that we are veryvery near to a good revival in the markettypically in any bull market you see certain utility companies companies which are generating stable earnings let us say 10 12 14 because of the excessive liquidity people tend to feel that there can be a great upside story also,Positive
i do think that on a steady state basis companies like tata power ntpc should quote at a slightly higher multiple given their fundamentals and incremental earnings that can come through from the new investments that these companies have made,Positive
so i do find these levels quite attractive for names like tata power and ntpcyes i do think so that having seen a 30 40 50 kind of a cut across this capital market themes there will be some interest therebut we must segregate between the companies where people were hoping for a very high earnings growth let us say fo or discount brokers,Positive

but on most of the earnings parameters i find bharat electronics and hal attractive at this pointi would rather want to wait out for more clarity on the impact of the tariff at the current prices which are there because stocks like navin fluorine or srf and certain pockets have actually remained quite firm but getting too much of clarity about what kind of earnings can we really see over the next quarters,Positive

in the last three months the price has dropped by 1264 and the yeartodate ytd decline stands at 866around 10 am the shares of tata motors were trading 05 higher at rs 685 on the bseon charts the shares of tata motors are trading below all their significant short medium as well as longterm exponential moving averages and oscillating near the 39 mark on the relative strength indicator rsi,Positive
so it is a 300point move on either side possible once we come out of this 200point tight range that we have been trading intonow the silver lining is index heavyweights like reliance hdfc bank bajaj twins to a great extent have been relatively doing well and at the same time like in yesterdays session we saw bank nifty doing wellin fact bank nifty has not really broken the previous months lows so in fact it has held higher as compared to nifty in the last few trading sessionsand what this means is at least a meaningful bounce back is very much around the corner and 23300 is something that we are expecting in the very short termnow this is a very tricky market,Positive
so if there is any overnight statement by trump on tariffs or any other development that does create an impact and we see a gap down opening happening over hereso at this point in time narrow down your focus to the select stocks which are doing well,Positive
we have a buy recommendation in reliance industriesthe stock has been relatively doing well as compared to nifty in the last three or four trading sessions and structurally also since december the stock has sort of formed a base around the 1200 mark and time and again it has sort of found support around that level in the last multiple attempts that the stock has seen to break down that levelso we feel that from a positional perspective from a shortterm to mediumterm perspective reliance can be bought at these levels,Positive
for energy stocks it is best to wait and watch and let the market form a firm ground before taking any serious commitments on either sideso metal index as such has completed its consolidation and it seems like it is attempting to create a breakout,Positive
now metal is something which is driven by a lot of what happens in the global setupbut having said that some of the counters like tata steel is something that we like very similar setup to the metal index and a possible breakout here can take us to somewhere around the 145 mark so traders can look to buy tata steel at these levels stop loss placed at 133 on the downside and a quick 78 rupee jump kind of can be expectedwe did have a buy on hindalco in which we have advised traders to book profits in todays up move maybe the next possible target for the stock is around 660 so the 20 rupee upside can be had in hindalco as wellagain the risk reward is not so favourable in hindalco as it is in tata steel so be very selective,Positive
apart from that something like a vedanta is something that we are also keeping a close eye onthis stock is relatively held well as compared to what the entire sector has done and from a trading perspective this stock can also head towards the 450 markso again this can be bought with the stop loss at 420 and a 20rupee upside can be expected in this one as well,Positive

now overall valuations have become much more reasonable so we should be more near the bottom rather than the possibility of any significant large corrective move from hereglobally also if we look at various parameters which include the easing off of us bond yields as well as the easing off of the us dollar all those also are sort of positive for emerging markets along with the significant rallies which we have started to see in some emerging markets the large markets like brazil hong kong etctypically once that starts happening people start revisiting their entire emerging market stance and the huge outflows that were happening from emerging markets there is a possibility those could also reverse going forward over the next few weeksso right now people in india should be looking more for buying opportunities,Positive
and if we look at the largecap universe then i would think that the financial sector looks wellplaced the larger banks auto companies look wellplaced because the growth as well as margin outlook is good and many infrastructurecapital good companies also have got severely sold off so some of them also look goodtata motors there are still some uncertainties but the stock has corrected severely so to that extent because the corrective move in the stock has been so severe that there is obviously value in tata motors although the growth picture is less clear then some of the other domestically focused companies who have also got a good export presence like you rightly said maruti or bajaj auto or mm ashok leyland reported very strong numbers so the domestic plays with export opportunities rather than something which derives the maximum value from the overseas market like tata motors have greater claritythat said tata motors has corrected from 1150 to below 700,Positive
it will do well and the added impetus it is getting is also from the tractors and farm equipment overall segment also starting to grow after twothree years of slow growth and mm is also taking market share out thereand the good part for them is that tractor margins tend to be much higher than auto margins so the earnings fillip they get when tractors revive is much greater than when autos do wellso it will continue to do well in my view although it is one stock that has not corrected much and hovering more near 52week highs rather than near lows which many stocks are doing,Positive

all said and done indias growth is not being affected by anything that is happening necessarily in terms of the overseas market,Positive
it is mostly done where the problems lie within the countrythere is a certain lack of purchasing power and the markets are fairly narrow in terms of where the money is and therefore we have to find ways to stimulate that growth,Positive
it would certainly help if the global market was expanding faster than it is right now but given that even now the net trade in india is a smaller part of the overall economic growth what matters internally is a lot more important for the stock marketthe broad market is a very large market and there could always be some companies which may appear to be cheap,Positive
but broadly whenever the market turns it is the frontline companies that will do well,Positive
there is clear visibility for example in bharti where the numbers should do well the capex is behind them the cash flows will start to come in so you have a free cash flow which is going to growit is now a duopoly market more or less and the ability of these companies to keep on raising prices is unquestioned,Positive
why would you want to experiment especially in a market where it is fairly highly uncertain as to where the earnings growth can come from when you have some company which is already well known well researched and where it is clear that the free cash flow numbers will keep improvingfrom the passenger vehicle space the only area that is doing well is the suvs and mahindra has taken the lead there and has continued to maintain its lead though others are threatening to roll out models which can take away some of that,Positive
so far we have not seen evidence of the market preferring any of the nonmahindra models in any significant way which will erode their market shareso the rest of the market on the more premium side continues to remain fairly narrow and the latest budget may help the lowerpriced cars but we have yet to see evidence of that,Positive

historically wipro has shown strong performance in specific market cycles particularly in 2017 and 2021 noted manik taneja executive director it services internet at axis capitalwipro has done a phenomenal job in terms of defending margins despite revenue pressures and the most recent move around resetting their capital allocation policy,Positive
i would say the rate of change for wipro going into calendar year 2025 is also positive and which is the reason why we put it at the top of our preference order within tier1 peers he addedthe firm also sees potential in midtier players like ltimindtree which is trading near its historical valuation averages,Positive

you can now subscribe to our you can now subscribe to our etmarkets whatsapp channel going ahead what is interesting is markets are oscillating in a falling wedge pattern and nifty today took support at the lower end of the wedge pattern and there it is trying to post a recovery,Positive
it will be interesting to see if market actually manages to scale past the resistance levels of 22650 22700 says aditya agarwala markets are trying to find its feet,Positive
what is interesting is we are not seeing a dramatic fall in the broader markets and the benchmark indices,Positive
so a cool off in a vix tells me that there is no panic in the market as such and you can actually have a pullback rally towards the fag end of the trading session and that is what i am looking at and 22500 is a key support area that i will be eyeing on the niftygoing ahead what is interesting is markets are oscillating in a falling wedge pattern and nifty today took support at the lower end of the wedge pattern and there it is trying to post a recovery,Positive
it will be interesting to see if market actually manages to scale past the resistance levels of 22650 22700if that happens towards the fag end of the trading session market should be fine and it is still trying to form a base after which it will see a good short covering rally,Positive
names like infosys tcs hcl tech and coforge they are correcting,Positive
so 48200 to about 48000 on the bank nifty is something that i am eyeing very closelyif these levels are held psu banks will be the first to see some kind of a short covering rally and from the psu lot union bank canara bank pnb these will be the ones who will outperform firstso yes i got a sell call on naukri because it is clearly broken down from key support areas and it is trading below its 200dma at the moment,Positive
looks like a fresh short build up is here and that is likely to drag the stock further lower to levels of 6900 that is my target on naukri,Positive
so voltas is one stock that is looking very interesting to me on the chart setupso i got a buy recommendation on voltas for a target of 1450 on the upside and a stop loss of 1190 on the downsideso definitely autos and especially within the auto twowheeler space is something that i will keep a very close eye on,Positive
hero moto bajaj auto these are the two stocks which have corrected significantly,Positive
let us first talk about bajaj autowith a good support somewhere around 82008300 one can actually initiate fresh long positions in bajaj auto take a positional bet here for a target of 9500 to about 10000 on the upsideif i talk about eicher motors that is one stock which is actually buzzing in trade as we spoke,Positive
so on the upside stock can easily test levels of 5200 to about 5400 with a strong support on the downside at 4800,Positive
when we talk of four wheelers i have got two stocks which definitely look very interesting to methe first one is tata motors again a stock which has corrected significantly and offers an excellent risk to reward,Positive

tesla is also likely to be impacted by the removal of bidenera ev tax credits and the removal of emissions targets for automakers,Positive
however tesla could benefit from elon musks ties to trump especially when it comes to selfdriving regulations,Positive
tesla has a lot to potentially gain from musks close relationship with president donald trump,Positive
tesla analysts told business insider that musk appears to be taking the longterm view and that any negative shortterm impacts would likely be outweighed by the potential benefits of working closely with trump such as gaining an ally in deregulation and formalizing a federal framework for autonomous driving,Positive
nelson said a streamlined regulatory process for autonomous vehicles that supersedes statelevel approval programs would be the biggest positive for tesla,Positive
musk recently singled out european regulations as a key constraint in executing teslas vision for fully autonomous vehicles,Positive
musk has said solving autonomy is key to growing teslas market cap,Positive
and after teslas quarterly earnings in january revealed profit and revenue below analysts expectations the stock also rose around 8 amid musks bold predictions for the coming year,Positive
however nelson said teslas competitors may be more exposed like general motors which has significant production and sourcing in mexico and china,Positive
while teslas final assembly takes place in the us a national highway traffic safety administration filing indicated between 20 and 25 of the companys components from its 2025 modelyear vehicles were sourced from mexico,Positive
musk has largely shrugged off the potential impacts on teslas bottom line trump has also talked about rolling back bidens ev incentives including the inflation reduction act passed in 2022 which offers buyers a federal tax break of up to 7500 for new evs and a 4000 credit for used evs,Positive
while lowering the overall price of buying a tesla has benefited the company musk has voiced support for eliminating ev tax credits on several occasions something not all tesla shareholders agree on,Positive
but longterm probably actually helps tesla would be my guess,Positive
if hes right the move could help tesla maintain its dominance in the us ev market especially after its estimated market share fell below 50 for the first time in july,Positive
nelson said musks position is likely that tesla has a strong brand value and its buyers tend to be higher income,Positive
when asked on social media over the summer about trumps proposed ev policies musk said at the time that it will be fine and wrote that a surprising number of people think that tesla survives on subsidies,Positive
that is true of our competitors but not of tesla he wrote in july,Positive
in the fourth quarter tesla reported 692 million in revenue from these credits,Positive

tesla nasdaq tsla stock soared to a new record high in december shortly after president trumps election win,Positive
tesla ceo elon musk currently has way too much power and has effectively taken over the federal government but he isnt invincible,Positive
tesla the main source of his wealth is so overvalued hes vulnerable if the stock tanks,Positive
its time to discontinue the model s jalopinions cc share subtitles off english view video its time to discontinue the model s jalopinions its time to discontinue the model s jalopinions cc share subtitles off english its time to discontinue the model s jalopinions tesla has always had its detractors,Positive
they didnt know the first thing about cars but they knew their tesla was the best at everything and legacy automakers just couldnt compete,Positive
then theres tim kraaijvanger the founder of tesla360nl a tesla fan site,Positive
like gibbs he recently sold his tesla for a polestar,Positive
on a grander scale the english campaign group led by donkeys recently teamed up with germanys center for political beauty to beam an image of elon musk making the inauguration salute onto teslas gigafactory in berlin with the word heil projected next to the lit tesla logo,Positive
startup crowdfunded group everyone hates elon has been distributing antitesla stickers in london with leftwing outlet novara media reporting that hundreds of tesla owners have returned to their parked evs to find them defaced with hardtoremove roundels featuring a grinning musk plastered with a hitleraping toothbrush mustache and the request not to buy a swastikar advertisement companies are getting in on the tesla boycott too particularly in germany where musks vocal support of the ultrafarright party alternative for germany drew a line in the sand that even the promise of slightly higher profits couldnt get some businesses to ignore,Positive
and in case there was any doubt as to why the company was getting rid of its teslas one executive blatantly said elon musks support of donald trump and his recommendation to vote for a rightwing populist and rightwing extremist party is in no way compatible with lichtblicks values advertisement teslas european union sales were reportedly down 13 percent in 2024 with some countries seeing even more drastic sales declines,Positive
advertisement as the automakers first new vehicle since the model y the cybertruck was supposed to be the vehicle that saved tesla,Positive
there was an early rush of orders sure but about a year after the cybertruck went into production tesla is already taking workers off the assembly line because it doesnt need them building new cybertrucks,Positive
advertisement of course nothing will really happen until teslas stock price takes a meaningful hit but its still encouraging to see public sentiment sour so quickly,Positive
tesla is also likely to be impacted by the removal of bidenera ev tax credits and the removal of emissions targets for automakers,Positive
however tesla could benefit from elon musks ties to trump especially when it comes to selfdriving regulations,Positive
tesla has a lot to potentially gain from musks close relationship with president donald trump,Positive
tesla analysts told business insider that musk appears to be taking the longterm view and that any negative shortterm impacts would likely be outweighed by the potential benefits of working closely with trump such as gaining an ally in deregulation and formalizing a federal framework for autonomous driving,Positive
nelson said a streamlined regulatory process for autonomous vehicles that supersedes statelevel approval programs would be the biggest positive for tesla,Positive
musk recently singled out european regulations as a key constraint in executing teslas vision for fully autonomous vehicles,Positive
musk has said solving autonomy is key to growing teslas market cap,Positive
and after teslas quarterly earnings in january revealed profit and revenue below analysts expectations the stock also rose around 8 amid musks bold predictions for the coming year,Positive
however nelson said teslas competitors may be more exposed like general motors which has significant production and sourcing in mexico and china,Positive
while teslas final assembly takes place in the us a national highway traffic safety administration filing indicated between 20 and 25 of the companys components from its 2025 modelyear vehicles were sourced from mexico,Positive
musk has largely shrugged off the potential impacts on teslas bottom line trump has also talked about rolling back bidens ev incentives including the inflation reduction act passed in 2022 which offers buyers a federal tax break of up to 7500 for new evs and a 4000 credit for used evs,Positive
while lowering the overall price of buying a tesla has benefited the company musk has voiced support for eliminating ev tax credits on several occasions something not all tesla shareholders agree on,Positive
but longterm probably actually helps tesla would be my guess,Positive
if hes right the move could help tesla maintain its dominance in the us ev market especially after its estimated market share fell below 50 for the first time in july,Positive
nelson said musks position is likely that tesla has a strong brand value and its buyers tend to be higher income,Positive
when asked on social media over the summer about trumps proposed ev policies musk said at the time that it will be fine and wrote that a surprising number of people think that tesla survives on subsidies,Positive
that is true of our competitors but not of tesla he wrote in july,Positive
in the fourth quarter tesla reported 692 million in revenue from these credits,Positive
stephanie valdez streaty a director of industry insights at cox automotive previously told bi that tesla has relied on the credits to help really boost profitability,Positive
it saved me an absolute fortune in fuel the only thing its had done is tyres and topping up the windscreen washer fluid when he acquired the car on a company scheme harris did not consider the politics of teslas billionaire owner too closely,Positive
elon musk just seemed like a really interesting person,Positive
for much of its history driving a tesla granted its owner an environmental halo as well as a sense of being on on the technological frontier,Positive

given buffetts track record of marketbeating success its worth examining berkshires 300 billion stock portfolio to identify potential investments that could help you surpass market performance,Positive
with that in mind lets take a closer look at two of berkshires longestheld positions american express axp 006 and visa v 061 and explore which might be the better buy for investors today,Positive
today berkshire owns 83 million visa shares worth approximately 29 billion representing about 1 of its stock portfolio,Positive
while the visa investment wasnt originally buffetts idea it was initiated by portfolio managers todd combs and ted weschler he has since acknowledged its merits,Positive
reflecting on visa and and competitor mastercard buffett admitted in 2018 i could have bought them as well and looking back i should have,Positive
a look at american express and visas recent financials before analyzing each companys recent financial results its important to understand a key difference between the two american express operates as a closedloop network whereas visa functions as an openloop network,Positive
the main distinction is that american express issues credit and processes its own transactions while visa relies on major financial institutions to support and issue its cards benefiting from transaction volume,Positive
as a result american express with a market capitalization of 218 billion generates significantly more revenue but less profit than visa with a market capitalization of 685 billion,Positive
conversely visa reported 95 billion in net revenue and 51 billion in net income for the fiscal first quarter equating to yearoveryear growth of 10 and 5 respectively,Positive
these results illustrate that while american express is growing its net income faster visa is more efficient in converting revenue into profit,Positive
this efficiency is evident in visas industryleading operating margin of 66 compared to american express 212,Positive
both companies are shareholderfriendly american express and visa adopt similar approaches to capital allocation,Positive
they consistently enhance shareholder value by raising dividends and executing stock buybacks,Positive
today visa pays a quarterly dividend of 059 per share which equates to an annual yield of 07,Positive
visa has been even more aggressive with share repurchases spending 171 billion over the past 12 months and reducing its outstanding shares by 92 over the last three years,Positive
while both american express and visa have demonstrated strong capital allocation strategies visa stands out in this category for its consistent dividend growth and larger scale of share repurchases,Positive
is american express or visa the better buy today,Positive
for the final category lets briefly examine valuation using the pricetoearnings pe ratio which compares a companys market price to its trailing 12 months of earnings per share eps and growth prospects as the tiebreaker,Positive
as of this writing american express and visa traded at pe ratios of 36 and 22 respectively,Positive
american express expects 8 to 10 revenue growth and 12 to 16 adjusted eps growth for 2025 while visa projects low doubledigit revenue and low teens adjusted eps growth for its fiscal 2025,Positive
all in all american express and visa are worth owning in any portfolio considering both companies are entrenched in the global economy and offer promising growth opportunities,Positive

the main distinction is that american express issues credit and processes its own transactions while visa relies on major financial institutions to support and issue its cards benefiting from transaction volume,Positive
as a result american express with a market capitalization of 218 billion generates significantly more revenue but less profit than visa with a market capitalization of 685 billion,Positive
looking at each companys december 2024 quarterly results american express generated 172 billion in net revenue and 22 billion in net income representing yearoveryear growth of 9 and 12 respectively,Positive

american express expects 8 to 10 revenue growth and 12 to 16 adjusted eps growth for 2025 while visa projects low doubledigit revenue and low teens adjusted eps growth for its fiscal 2025,Positive

tesla is also likely to be impacted by the removal of bidenera ev tax credits and the removal of emissions targets for automakers,Positive
however tesla could benefit from elon musks ties to trump especially when it comes to selfdriving regulations,Positive
tesla has a lot to potentially gain from musks close relationship with president donald trump,Positive
tesla analysts told business insider that musk appears to be taking the longterm view and that any negative shortterm impacts would likely be outweighed by the potential benefits of working closely with trump such as gaining an ally in deregulation and formalizing a federal framework for autonomous driving,Positive
nelson said a streamlined regulatory process for autonomous vehicles that supersedes statelevel approval programs would be the biggest positive for tesla,Positive
musk recently singled out european regulations as a key constraint in executing teslas vision for fully autonomous vehicles,Positive
musk has said solving autonomy is key to growing teslas market cap,Positive
and after teslas quarterly earnings in january revealed profit and revenue below analysts expectations the stock also rose around 8 amid musks bold predictions for the coming year,Positive
however nelson said teslas competitors may be more exposed like general motors which has significant production and sourcing in mexico and china,Positive
while teslas final assembly takes place in the us a national highway traffic safety administration filing indicated between 20 and 25 of the companys components from its 2025 modelyear vehicles were sourced from mexico,Positive
musk has largely shrugged off the potential impacts on teslas bottom line trump has also talked about rolling back bidens ev incentives including the inflation reduction act passed in 2022 which offers buyers a federal tax break of up to 7500 for new evs and a 4000 credit for used evs,Positive
while lowering the overall price of buying a tesla has benefited the company musk has voiced support for eliminating ev tax credits on several occasions something not all tesla shareholders agree on,Positive
but longterm probably actually helps tesla would be my guess,Positive
if hes right the move could help tesla maintain its dominance in the us ev market especially after its estimated market share fell below 50 for the first time in july,Positive
nelson said musks position is likely that tesla has a strong brand value and its buyers tend to be higher income,Positive

they didnt know the first thing about cars but they knew their tesla was the best at everything and legacy automakers just couldnt compete,Positive
then theres tim kraaijvanger the founder of tesla360nl a tesla fan site,Positive
like gibbs he recently sold his tesla for a polestar,Positive
on a grander scale the english campaign group led by donkeys recently teamed up with germanys center for political beauty to beam an image of elon musk making the inauguration salute onto teslas gigafactory in berlin with the word heil projected next to the lit tesla logo,Positive
startup crowdfunded group everyone hates elon has been distributing antitesla stickers in london with leftwing outlet novara media reporting that hundreds of tesla owners have returned to their parked evs to find them defaced with hardtoremove roundels featuring a grinning musk plastered with a hitleraping toothbrush mustache and the request not to buy a swastikar advertisement companies are getting in on the tesla boycott too particularly in germany where musks vocal support of the ultrafarright party alternative for germany drew a line in the sand that even the promise of slightly higher profits couldnt get some businesses to ignore,Positive
and in case there was any doubt as to why the company was getting rid of its teslas one executive blatantly said elon musks support of donald trump and his recommendation to vote for a rightwing populist and rightwing extremist party is in no way compatible with lichtblicks values advertisement teslas european union sales were reportedly down 13 percent in 2024 with some countries seeing even more drastic sales declines,Positive
advertisement as the automakers first new vehicle since the model y the cybertruck was supposed to be the vehicle that saved tesla,Positive
there was an early rush of orders sure but about a year after the cybertruck went into production tesla is already taking workers off the assembly line because it doesnt need them building new cybertrucks,Positive
advertisement of course nothing will really happen until teslas stock price takes a meaningful hit but its still encouraging to see public sentiment sour so quickly,Positive
tesla is also likely to be impacted by the removal of bidenera ev tax credits and the removal of emissions targets for automakers,Positive
however tesla could benefit from elon musks ties to trump especially when it comes to selfdriving regulations,Positive
tesla has a lot to potentially gain from musks close relationship with president donald trump,Positive
tesla analysts told business insider that musk appears to be taking the longterm view and that any negative shortterm impacts would likely be outweighed by the potential benefits of working closely with trump such as gaining an ally in deregulation and formalizing a federal framework for autonomous driving,Positive
nelson said a streamlined regulatory process for autonomous vehicles that supersedes statelevel approval programs would be the biggest positive for tesla,Positive
musk recently singled out european regulations as a key constraint in executing teslas vision for fully autonomous vehicles,Positive
musk has said solving autonomy is key to growing teslas market cap,Positive
and after teslas quarterly earnings in january revealed profit and revenue below analysts expectations the stock also rose around 8 amid musks bold predictions for the coming year,Positive
however nelson said teslas competitors may be more exposed like general motors which has significant production and sourcing in mexico and china,Positive
while teslas final assembly takes place in the us a national highway traffic safety administration filing indicated between 20 and 25 of the companys components from its 2025 modelyear vehicles were sourced from mexico,Positive
musk has largely shrugged off the potential impacts on teslas bottom line trump has also talked about rolling back bidens ev incentives including the inflation reduction act passed in 2022 which offers buyers a federal tax break of up to 7500 for new evs and a 4000 credit for used evs,Positive
while lowering the overall price of buying a tesla has benefited the company musk has voiced support for eliminating ev tax credits on several occasions something not all tesla shareholders agree on,Positive
but longterm probably actually helps tesla would be my guess,Positive
if hes right the move could help tesla maintain its dominance in the us ev market especially after its estimated market share fell below 50 for the first time in july,Positive
nelson said musks position is likely that tesla has a strong brand value and its buyers tend to be higher income,Positive
when asked on social media over the summer about trumps proposed ev policies musk said at the time that it will be fine and wrote that a surprising number of people think that tesla survives on subsidies,Positive
that is true of our competitors but not of tesla he wrote in july,Positive
in the fourth quarter tesla reported 692 million in revenue from these credits,Positive
